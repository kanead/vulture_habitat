This annotated dataset comes from the Environmental Data Automated Track Annotation System (Env-DATA) on Movebank (movebank.org). The environmental data attributes are created and distributed by government and research organizations. For general information on the Env-DATA System, see Dodge et al. (2013) and movebank.org/node/6607.

Terms of Use: Verify the terms of use for relevant tracking data and environmental datasets prior to presenting or publishing these data. Terms of use for animal movement data in Movebank are defined by the study owners in the License Terms for the study. Terms of use for environmental datasets vary by provider; see below for details. When using these results in presentations or publications, acknowledge the use of Env-DATA and Movebank and cite Dodge et al. (2013). Sample acknowledgement: "[source product/variable] values were annotated using the Env-DATA System on Movebank (movebank.org)." Please send copies of published work to support@movebank.org.

File attributes

Attributes from the Movebank database (see the Movebank Attribute Dictionary at http://www.movebank.org/node/2381):
Location Lat: latitude in decimal degrees, WGS84 reference system
Location Long: longitude in decimal degrees, WGS84 reference system
Timestamp: the time of the animal location estimates, in UTC
Update Ts

Locations are the the geographic coordinates of locations along an animal track as estimated by the processed sensor data.

40 = closed to open (>15%) broadleaved evergreen and/or semi-deciduous forest (>5m)
50 = closed (>40%) broadleaved deciduous forest (>5m)
60 = open (15-40%) broadleaved deciduous forest (>5m)
70 = closed (>40%) needleleaved evergreen forest (>5m)
90 = open (15-40%) needleleaved deciduous or evergreen forest (>5m)
100 = closed to open (>15%) mixed broadleaved and needleleaved forest (>5m)

130 = closed to open (>15%) shrubland (<5m)
140 = closed to open (>15%) grassland
150 = sparse (>15%) vegetation (woody vegetation, shrubs, grassland)
160 = closed (>40%) broadleaved forest regularly flooded (fresh water)
170 = closed (>40%) broadleaved semi-deciduous and/or evergreen forest regularly flooded (saline water)
180 = closed to open (>15%) vegetation (grassland, shrubland, woody vegetation) on regularly flooded or waterlogged soil (fresh, brackish or saline water)
